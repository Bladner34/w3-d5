        This is a commit message I'd try to write but it was too long and git
        did not want to upload it. So I am pasting it here. One of my ACP'sP:
        During setup of html I accidentally messed up the boiler plate because I
        am wearing long nails and clicked on random keys without realizing it.
        Initially I thought I'd fixed the problem but after console log revealed
        an error message with the width value in the meta tag, I knew I hadnt
        fixed it. I copied a meta tag from a new page and pasted it into the
        same spot because I wasn't familiar with what part Id messed up. It is
        fixed now. I still have long nails." [main 5d9eecb] during setup of html
